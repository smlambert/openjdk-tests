 # Prerequisites:

 For a quick reference, you can see how most of the prereqs are setup on a Linux system in our test Dockerfiles, in [openjdk-tests/external/example-test/Dockerfile](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/external/example-test/dockerfile/Dockerfile#L33)

   * ant 1.7.1 or above with ant-contrib.jar
   * make 4.1 or above
   * perl 5.10.1 or above** 
   * curl 7.20.0 or above (needs -J/--remote-header-name support)

   * docker (needed if you wish to run Docker-based external test group)

 Note for testing on Windows platform, cygwin is also required.  

 At the AdoptOpenJDK project, Ansible scripts are used to setup test machines.  You can find them in the ansible directory of the [openjdk-infrastructure repo](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure).
